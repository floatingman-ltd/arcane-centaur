# Test & Validation Plan

Single source of truth for change validation. Each section covers one change:
prepare the branch → validate → raise PR → merge → confirm post-merge.

**Workflow:** validate on the feature branch **before** raising a PR. Never merge first and test after.

Sample files for filetype and highlight tests are in `testdocs/` (`hello.hs`, `hello.cs`, `hello.fs`, `hello.fsx`; an existing richer `hello.lua` is also there).

## One-Time Test Machine Setup

Complete once before any testing begins.

- [X] Confirm Neovim ≥ 0.12 is installed: `nvim --version`
- [X] Confirm Git is installed: `git --version`
- [X] Confirm Node.js + npm are installed (required by markdown-preview.nvim build): `node --version && npm --version`
- [X] Confirm `dotnet` SDK is installed (required for Change 07 testing): `dotnet --version`
- [X] Install netcoredbg (required for Change 07 debugging tests) — **not** a NuGet tool; install from GitHub releases:
  ```bash
  NCDBG_VER=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases/latest \
    | grep '"tag_name"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
  curl -L "https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases/download/${NCDBG_VER}/netcoredbg-linux-amd64.tar.gz" \
    -o /tmp/netcoredbg.tar.gz
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/netcoredbg
  tar -xzf /tmp/netcoredbg.tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/netcoredbg/
  # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc then source it:
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/share/netcoredbg
  ```
- [X] Verify netcoredbg is on PATH: `netcoredbg --version`
- [ ] Install the Roslyn C# language server (required by `roslyn.nvim` for the C# LSP in Changes 03 & 07) — **not** a `dotnet tool`; download the native binary. Full steps in `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/languages/dotnet.adoc` § *Installing the Roslyn Language Server*:
  ```bash
  # The Roslyn LSP is NOT on nuget.org — it lives on Microsoft's Azure DevOps
  # "vs-impl" feed, and all releases are prereleases (no stable 5.x; newest is
  # 5.4.0-2.26179.14 as of this writing — there is no 5.5/5.6).
  PKG=microsoft.codeanalysis.languageserver.linux-x64
  FEED="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/azure-public/vside/_packaging/vs-impl/nuget/v3/flat2/${PKG}"
  VERSION=$(curl -s "${FEED}/index.json" | tr ',' '\n' | grep -oE '[0-9][0-9.]+-[0-9.]+' | sort -V | tail -1)
  echo "Installing Roslyn LSP ${VERSION}"
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/roslyn
  curl -L "${FEED}/${VERSION}/${PKG}.${VERSION}.nupkg" -o /tmp/roslyn.nupkg
  unzip -o /tmp/roslyn.nupkg -d ~/.local/share/roslyn
  chmod +x ~/.local/share/roslyn/content/LanguageServer/linux-x64/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer
  # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc then source it:
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/roslyn/content/LanguageServer/linux-x64:$PATH"
  ```
- [ ] Verify the Roslyn server is on PATH: `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer --version`
- [ ] Confirm a C compiler is available (nvim-treesitter compiles `fsharp`/`c_sharp` parsers from source): `cc --version` (install `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu if missing)
- [X] Confirm `claude` CLI is installed and authenticated (required for Change 08): `claude --version`
- [X] Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:floatingman-ltd/arcane-centaur.git ~/.config/nvim`
- [X] Confirm initial main state loads: `nvim` → `:Lazy sync` → no errors in `:messages`

## Change 03 · migrate-completion-blink

**Branch:** `feat/03-migrate-completion-blink`

This branch includes Changes 01 (treesitter textobjects) and 02 (asciidoc authoring) — both were merged
to main before this branch was created and are inherited here. Validate all three on this branch
before raising the PR.

### Prepare

1. `git fetch origin && git checkout feat/03-migrate-completion-blink`
2. Launch Neovim: `:Lazy sync` — wait for completion
3. `:TSUpdate` — wait for completion

- [X] Branch checked out, `:Lazy sync` and `:TSUpdate` complete with no errors

---

### Validate — Change 01: treesitter textobjects

#### 3.1 — Parser install

1. Run `:TSInstallInfo`. Confirm the following parsers show `installed`: `lua`, `fsharp`, `c_sharp`.
   - **`lua` is bundled with Neovim** (`$VIMRUNTIME/parser/lua.so`) — it always shows installed and highlights even with zero nvim-treesitter parsers, so it is **not** proof the plugin compiled anything. `fsharp` and `c_sharp` are the meaningful checks.
   - `haskell` is in `ensure_installed` but optional — skip if not a Haskell dev machine.
   - Compiling `fsharp`/`c_sharp` requires a **C compiler on PATH** (`cc`/`gcc`; `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu). Without it the install fails silently and 3.2 will show a `nil` highlighter.
   - If `fsharp` or `c_sharp` show **not installed** after `:TSUpdate`:
     a. Run `:TSInstall fsharp c_sharp` explicitly and wait.
     b. Run `:messages` — look for any compile or download error.
     c. Re-run `:TSInstallInfo` to check status again.
2. Run `:messages` — scan for any `textobjects` or `treesitter` errors. There should be none.

- [X] `lua`, `fsharp`, and `c_sharp` parsers installed; no treesitter errors in `:messages`
      _(Note: the underlying cause was a config bug — `ensure_installed` was being ignored, so parsers never auto-installed. Fixed in commit `8080040`; after `git pull` + `:Lazy sync` they install automatically when a C compiler is present. See the 3.2 diagnosis.)_

#### 3.2 — Highlight active per filetype

1. Open `lua/plugins/treesitter.lua`. Run `:set ft?` — expect `filetype=lua`.
2. Run `:lua print(vim.treesitter.highlighter.active[vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()])` — should print a table (not `nil`).
3. Open `testdocs/hello.fsx`. Run `:set ft?` (expect `fsharp`) and repeat the highlighter check.
4. Open `testdocs/hello.cs`. Repeat both checks (`c_sharp` highlight active).
5. _(Optional — skip if not a Haskell machine)_ Open `testdocs/hello.hs`. Repeat both checks.

- [ ] `lua`, `fsharp`, and `c_sharp` files show correct filetype and non-nil highlighter
>  - `lua` works as expected
>  - `c_sharp` and `fsharp` resolve to correct file type
>  - `c_sharp` and `fsharp` both return a `nil` table result
>  - `c_sharp`when loaded was unable ot spawn a language server, '... `{"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer", "--stdio"} failed. The language server is either not installed, missing from PATH, or not executable.'
>
> **Diagnosis / resolution — ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED (commit `8080040`):**
> - Not a missing-parser problem at heart. `lua/plugins/treesitter.lua` passed all its settings via lazy's `opts`, which lazy applies by calling `require("nvim-treesitter").setup(opts)`. On nvim-treesitter **master** that entry point takes **no arguments and discards `opts`** — so `highlight`, `indent`, `textobjects`, **and `ensure_installed`** never took effect. That's why `c_sharp`/`fsharp` had no highlighter *and* why their parsers were never auto-installed (3.3 textobjects would have failed for the same reason).
> - `lua` (and `markdown`) appeared to "work" only because **Neovim's core** treesitter highlights them independently of the plugin — masking the bug. A working `lua` highlighter is *not* evidence the plugin is configured.
> - **Fix:** route opts through `require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup(opts)` via an explicit `config` function; corrected invalid `ensure_installed` names (`lisp`→`commonlisp`, dropped `plantuml` — both threw "Parser not available" once opts applied); disabled markdown TS highlight to preserve the markdown hotfix. Verified on the dev machine: `c_sharp`/`fsharp`/`lua` highlighters all non-nil, `af`/`if`/`]f`/`[f` textobjects mapped, markdown opens with no nil-range/languagetree error (baseline unchanged).
> - **To re-validate here:** `git pull`, then `:Lazy sync` — `ensure_installed` now auto-installs the parsers (a **C compiler** must be on PATH; see One-Time Setup). Then re-run steps 1–5.
> - The `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer` error is **separate/unrelated** — the Roslyn C# LSP server isn't installed (see the Roslyn step in *One-Time Test Machine Setup*). C# LSP is not required for this highlight check.

#### 3.3 — Textobject motions (non-Lisp buffer)

1. Open `lua/plugins/treesitter.lua` and position the cursor inside a function body.
2. Press `vaf` — the entire function including its signature should be selected.
3. Press `vif` — only the body should be selected.
4. Move to a function parameter and press `via` — the argument should be selected.
5. Position on a function and press `daf` — the whole function should be deleted.
6. Undo (`u`). Press `]f` — cursor jumps to the next function start. Press `[f` — jumps back.

- [ ] All six sub-steps behave as described

#### 3.4 — Textobjects disabled in Lisp buffers

1. Open a `.clj` file with a `defn` form. Press `vaf`.
2. Confirm selection follows parentheses (vim-sexp s-expression), not an indented block (treesitter function).
3. Repeat with a `.lisp` and a `.janet` file.

- [ ] vim-sexp behaviour unchanged in all three Lisp filetypes

#### 3.5 — Unrelated bracket maps intact

1. In a git repo, open a file with a staged/unstaged hunk. Press `]h` / `[h` — jump between hunks.

2. Run `:set ft?` — expect `filetype=asciidoctor`.
3. Move to a section heading (`==` line). Press `za` — section folds. Press `za` — unfolds.
4. Find a `[source,lua]` block — Lua inside should be highlighted differently from surrounding AsciiDoc.

- [ ] Filetype correct, fold works, fenced-block highlight active

#### 4.3 — Docker preview maps

1. In the `.adoc` buffer press `,p` (`<localleader>p`).
   - Docker running: browser tab or terminal output showing rendered HTML.
   - Docker not running: clean warning/error — no Neovim crash.
2. Press `,pp` — same preview flow.
3. Press `,pa` — Antora build starts (or clean Docker-offline message).

- [ ] All three maps fire without crashing Neovim

#### 4.5 — Markdown unaffected; markview absent

- [ ] Conjure completions appear (or absence is noted for follow-up)

#### 3.6 — Spell completions gated by `spell` option

1. Open a markdown file. Run `:set spell`. Type 3+ characters of a misspelled word — spell suggestions appear.
2. Open a Lua file (`:set spell?` is `nospell`). Type the same misspelled word — no spell suggestions.

- [ ] Spell completions gated correctly by the `spell` option

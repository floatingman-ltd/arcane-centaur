# Validation Test Plan

Checklist for validating each change on the test machine.
Test cases are captured separately in `openspec/MANUAL_VALIDATION.md`.
Work through this list top to bottom — each section must pass before moving to the next.

## One-Time Test Machine Setup

Complete once before any testing begins.

- [X] Confirm Neovim ≥ 0.12 is installed: `nvim --version`
- [X] Confirm Git is installed: `git --version`
- [X] Confirm Node.js + npm are installed (required by markdown-preview.nvim build): `node --version && npm --version`
- [X] Confirm `dotnet` SDK is installed (required for Change 07 testing): `dotnet --version`
- [ ] Install netcoredbg (required for Change 07 debugging tests) — **not** a NuGet tool; install from GitHub releases:
  ```bash
  # 1. Download the latest linux-amd64 release
  #    Check https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases for current version
  NCDBG_VER=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases/latest \
    | grep '"tag_name"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
  curl -L "https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg/releases/download/${NCDBG_VER}/netcoredbg-linux-amd64.tar.gz" \
    -o /tmp/netcoredbg.tar.gz

  # 2. Extract to ~/.local/share/netcoredbg/
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/netcoredbg
  tar -xzf /tmp/netcoredbg.tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/netcoredbg/

  # 3. Add to PATH (add this line to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc, then source it)
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/share/netcoredbg
  ```
- [ ] Verify netcoredbg is on PATH: `netcoredbg --version`
- [ ] Confirm `claude` CLI is installed and authenticated (required for Change 08): `claude --version`
- [ ] Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:floatingman-ltd/arcane-centaur.git ~/.config/nvim`
- [ ] Confirm initial main state loads: `nvim` → `:Lazy sync` → no errors in `:messages`

# Things we'd like to add

1. Additional language support
   - javascript
   - typescript
   - assembler
   - terraform
   - lua
2. some sort of visual buffer tabbing:
   - the sidebar panels for claude.cli and avanate.nvim are awkward to read, it seems both would like to be "full screen" 
   - the terminal at the bottom of the screen requires scrolling, it too would like a "full screen"
3. signature help, and a way to browse method overloads. Today there is no way to see a method's
   other overloads. Roslyn collapses them into a *single* completion item and just notes the count
   ("+16 overloads"), so the completion documentation window cannot page through them — it renders
   one item's docs and there is no second item to move to. Overloads belong to a different LSP
   request, `textDocument/signatureHelp`, which is switched off here on both available paths:
   blink's own module has `signature.enabled = false`, and `on_attach` in `lua/config/lsp.lua`
   binds no `vim.lsp.buf.signature_help`. Enabling blink's would not be sufficient on its own
   either: its window renders only `signatures[(activeSignature or 0) + 1]`
   (`signature/window.lua:54`) and the command set is just `show_signature` / `hide_signature` /
   `scroll_signature_up` / `scroll_signature_down` — there is **no overload-cycling command**. So
   this needs signature help turned on *plus* something that actually cycles signatures, with its
   own keybindings and doc updates. Surfaced while validating `fix-blink-completion-keymap`; well
   outside that change, which is a keymap consolidation.

## Things to keep an eye on

Not defects — they work as designed — but ergonomics we are not yet sure about. Left to settle with
use before deciding.

- **`<C-n>` carries several meanings, separated only by mode.** In normal mode it opens the file
  tree (`lua/keymaps.lua`); in insert mode it is both the manual completion trigger *and*
  select-next; on the command line it is select-next. The separation is clean and was verified
  (TEST_PLAN BC.10: `:verbose nmap <C-n>` resolves to `:NvimTreeOpen<CR>`, `:verbose imap <C-n>` to
  the blink mapping, no leakage either way) — but "same chord, four jobs" is a lot to hold, and it
  already caused one false failure during validation, where pressing it a moment before entering
  insert mode opened the tree instead of the completion menu.

  Worth noting if this is revisited: **the tree role is the cheapest to give up.** Once
  `fix-tree-terminal-keymaps` lands, the tree answers to `<leader>t` (toggle), `<C-t>` (toggle),
  `<leader>n` (open) and `<C-f>` (reveal) — so dropping `<C-n>` would remove nothing that is not
  already covered twice over, and would leave `<C-n>` meaning one thing: completion, in both modes
  that have it. The alternative, moving the completion trigger instead, is worse — it is constrained
  to plain `Ctrl`-plus-letter chords by the WSL console, and `<C-n>` is what stock Vim already means
  in insert mode.

  Deferred deliberately: see how it feels in daily use first.

## Things that seem broken

- the terminal opens at **reduced width when toggled from inside the tree window**, instead of full width. Measured in a 171-column terminal: opened from the text pane `winwidth(0)` is 171 (correct); opened from the tree it is 140 — which is 171 minus the 30-column tree minus its separator, i.e. the split lands below the *editor column* rather than spanning the screen. The tree stays full height beside it.

  This contradicts an existing requirement. `openspec/specs/ide-layout/spec.md` — *Requirement: Full-width terminal toggle* — says the terminal SHALL open full-width at the bottom "regardless of which window has focus when invoked", with a scenario explicitly stating "not inside the tree column". `toggle_terminal` in `lua/keymaps.lua` does use `botright split`, which should be unconditional, so something is relocating the window afterwards; nvim-tree re-establishing its own layout on `WinNew` is the obvious suspect but is **unconfirmed**. Not reproducible headlessly — a scripted run with the same arrangement produced a correct full-width 171 split, so the trigger is not understood.

  `<leader>L` (IDE layout assembly) is **not** affected — it opens its terminal full-width through the same `botright split` code, which narrows the fault to `toggle_terminal` invoked with focus already in the tree window rather than to the split call itself.

  Found during `fix-tree-terminal-keymaps` validation (TEST_PLAN TK.3/TK.4) and deliberately **not fixed there**: the terminal panel's split approach is itself under review (see the full-screen panel idea above), so effort spent on the current geometry may be wasted. Revisit if the panel survives in its present form.

- `<leader>t` is supposed to toggle the treeview but it toggles the terminal if it has been opened

- snippet placeholders cannot be navigated. `snippets` is an active completion source
  (`lua/plugins/blink.lua:26`), so snippet completions are offered and expand — but
  `snippet_forward` / `snippet_backward` are bound nowhere in the config, and the insert-mode
  keymap uses `preset = "none"`, so nothing supplies them by default either. Once a snippet is
  accepted there is no way to jump between its placeholders. A pre-existing gap rather than a
  regression; explicitly out of scope for the `fix-blink-completion-keymap` change, which only
  addresses the manual trigger and the cross-mode accept key.
